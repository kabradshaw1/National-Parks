# National Park Search
National parks are some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places in the country, and we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy them. However, for people with disabilities, visiting national parks can sometimes be a challenge due to lack of accessibility. That's where our website comes in.

Our website aims to provide aid in the form retrieving information of national parks in the United States that are handicap accessible. Thus making it easier for people with disabilities to plan their visits and make the most of their time at the national parks.
